It's always been my dream to become a developer: I love problem solving, I love computers and technology, and so it's a good fit. Illness forced me to withdraw from my Computer Science degree before I could complete my final year but my determination spurs me on! As a Makers graduate, I'm getting my life back on track and I aim to make my dream a reality.

## Interesting Projects
* TDD, emphasising BDD. Testing frameworks: `RSpec`, `Jasmine`, `pytest`
* Attention to code quality: e.g. `rubocop`, `eslint`, `pylint`
* Integrating with services to track test coverage and code quality: e.g. `Coveralls`, `CodeClimate` 
* CI/CD with `Travis CI` and `Heroku`

## More about me

I am passionate about solving real problems and building useful things, using code. Life, health, and circumstances might have had other ideas but software engineering has been a lifelong ambition that I am now making a reality, thanks to the Makers Fellowship programme.

My journey started in primary school with a little pixellated turtle. Moving it around the screen with commands in Logo might not have looked like much but it was the spark that opened my mind to the possibilities of programming, and I've been hooked ever since. From there: QuickBASIC (from the Windows 95 CD-ROM!), Visual Basic, C/C++, C#, Java and now more recently, Ruby and JavaScript. The language may change but the problem-solving thought process is universal.

In a time when 28.8k dial-up internet was common and 56k was bleeding edge, when the web was rather more read-only (compared to what it is now), my interest was in making desktop applications that ran locally - and I dreamed of being a games developer. technology, and my perspective, has evolved a lot since then and my mind is open to the possibilities that now exist: the web is _the_ platform and I want to build web applications - and not necessarily games!

So now I'm looking for my first developer job: if you're a prospective employer looking at this then I would love to discuss with *you* what kind of real problems you want to solve, and what sort of useful things we can build!


## Skills

#### I am proactive

At the first Editors meeting, I enquired why we didn't appear to have a website. Turns out it had gone down some time ago but no one knew why. Furthermore, I was alarmed that one seemed to think it was that important. I think any kind of publication really ought to have website so on my own initiative I offered to investigate and bring it back online.

- It was a WordPress based site. Someone had modified core code and then the site broke when a WordPress update was applied on top
- I should point out that I was not any kind of WordPress expert so this was pure troubleshooting and problem-solving- Fortunately, the database was intact so I was able to create a backup, install WordPress from scratch and then restore all the old posts
- In getting the website back up, I became the new *Web Editor* alongside my existing role. I was responsible for routine maintenance and provided the team with ongoing support so that they could use the website
- Producing that proof-of-concept demonstrated the importance and viability of having a website
- [The website](http://sparknewspaper.co.uk/) lives! They took my MVP, ran with it and now it's looking better than it ever did :grin:


#### I like to write things

At university I did a lot of work with the student newspaper (called _Spark_ or currently, _The Spark_). I started off sending in my submissions but towards the end of my time there, I applied for the soon-to-be vacant position of Science & Technology editor and got the job. In the end there was another great applicant so we shared the job and edited alternate issues.
- I introduced an Editorial column, replacing a column that summarised a few selected news articles, because I thought it was important that we have a dialogue with our readers. And I would still get to write.
- [Here](https://issuu.com/sparkweb/docs/spark_62-3/34) is the final issue we worked on, where we reflected and wrote our farewells. During that time we handled onboarding of the new editor, remaining available to support and mentor.
- Current and earlier issues are available on [Issuu](https://issuu.com/sparkweb)
