## David Thai
_probably too long but better to have but too much and have to tighten than not enough_

I am passionate about solving real problems and building useful things, using code. Life, health, and circumstances might have had other ideas but software engineering has been a constant and unrelenting lifelong ambition that has become reality via the Makers Fellowship program.

My journey started in primary school with a little pixellated turtle. Moving it around the screen with commands in Logo might not have looked like much but it was the spark that opened my mind to the possibilities of programming, and I've been hooked ever since. From there: QuickBASIC, Visual Basic, C/C++, C#, Java and now more recently, Ruby and JavaScript. The language may change but the problem-solving thought process is universal.

In a time when 28.8k dial-up internet was common and 56k was bleeding edge, when the web was a read-only resource in comparison to now, my interest was in making desktop applications that ran locally - and I dreamed of being a games developer. Techology, and my perspective, has evolved since then and I am not so narrow minded: the web is _the_ platform and I want to build web applications - and not necessarily games!

And now I'm looking for my first developer job: I would love to discuss with ***you***, prospective employer, what kind of real problems I can help you to solve, and what sort of useful things we can build!
