It's always been my dream to become a developer: I love problem solving, I love computers and technology, and so it's a good fit. Illness forced me to withdraw from my Computer Science degree before I could complete my final year but my determination spurs me on! As a Makers graduate, I'm getting my life back on track and I aim to make my dream a reality.

As part of my process I endeavour to apply the following:
* TDD, emphasising BDD. Testing frameworks: `RSpec`, `Jasmine`, `pytest`
* Attention to code quality: e.g. `rubocop`, `eslint`, `pylint`
* Integrating with services to track test coverage and code quality: e.g. `Coveralls`, `CodeClimate` 
* CI/CD with `Travis CI` and `Heroku`

## Education

### Makers Academy (January 2019 - April 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code.
- Fast, independent learner
- Great collaborator
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Rails
- RSpec, Jasmine, Cypress, pytest

### University of Reading

#### DipHE Applied Computer Science (2006 - deferred)

I took my first formal **programming** courses, in **C** & **C++**. Relatively less friendly, but learning the language and fundamental programming concepts made every other language I would later encounter more accessible, e.g. **Java**, **C#**.

The **algorithms** module introduced me to algorithmic complexity and **Python**.

In **computer architecture**, **operating systems**, and **compilers**, I gained insight into the relationship between hardware and software, and how computers work under the hood.



_Withdrew before I could complete the degree but check out what I got up to in student media:_
  * Wrote and presented **News @ [Junction11](https://www.junction11radio.co.uk)** (student radio station)
  * **Science & Technology Editor** and **Web Editor** at **[Spark*](https://sparknewspaper.co.uk/)**, (student newspaper)
  * Worked with members of **RU:ON TV** (student TV station) to develop story and star in the short film _[This Dead Planet](https://vimeo.com/40466856)_, an entry for the 2012 [Sci-Fi London 48 Hour Film Competition](https://48hour.sci-fi-london.com/)

_...and also the **Microsoft Imagine Cup** - it's like a worldwide code jam for students:_
- [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Cup) 2007 Software Design UK Finals - Theme: _Better Education_- Team Leader
- [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Cup) 2006 Software Design UK Finals - Theme: _Healthier Lives_- Team Member

#### Science Foundation Year (2005 - 2006)

Physics (77%); Mathematics (75.5%); Electrical Science (67%)


## More about me

I am passionate about solving real problems and building useful things, using code. Life, health, and circumstances might have had other ideas but software engineering has been a lifelong ambition that I am now making a reality, thanks to the Makers Fellowship programme.

My journey started in primary school with a little pixellated turtle. Moving it around the screen with commands in Logo might not have looked like much but it was the spark that opened my mind to the possibilities of programming, and I've been hooked ever since. From there: QuickBASIC (from the Windows 95 CD-ROM!), Visual Basic, C/C++, C#, Java and now more recently, Ruby and JavaScript. The language may change but the problem-solving thought process is universal.

In a time when 28.8k dial-up internet was common and 56k was bleeding edge, when the web was rather more read-only (compared to what it is now), my interest was in making desktop applications that ran locally - and I dreamed of being a games developer. technology, and my perspective, has evolved a lot since then and my mind is open to the possibilities that now exist: the web is _the_ platform and I want to build web applications - and not necessarily games!


## Skills

The value of my side-projects and extra-curricular activities is that they have been such a good way to hone my skills:

#### I can justify my position and bring others with me

The website of the student newspaper had gone down a while ago, and had remained so. No one knew what to do about it and they were concerned about the time/money/skills that would be needed to fix it.

I suggested that it was important for a newspaper to have a functioning website and I persuaded the team to support the website project by laying out a plan for going forward: I could start by doing some troubleshooting on my own to diagnose the problem so that we would know if it would actually cost anything at all.

#### I am a _proactive_ problem solver

I determined the problem, and demonstrating *initiative* I took ownership of the issue and got the site back up and running.

#### I write

Whether it was my work on the University of Reading student newspaper, [The Spark](https://issuu.com/sparkweb/docs) or my [blogging](https://blog.makersacademy.com/tagged/makers-survival-guide) while at Makers, I have always been keen on communicating in writing to share knowledge and ideas with others.
