It's always been my dream to become a developer: I love problem solving, I love computers and technology, and so it's a good fit. Illness forced me to withdraw from my Computer Science degree before I could complete my final year but my determination spurs me on! As a Makers graduate, I'm getting my life back on track and I aim to make my dream a reality.

## Education

### Makers Academy (January 2019 - April 2019)

Learning how to apply industry-standard best practices to write *clean code* to *solve problems* 

- **Fast, self-led learning:**
  - Rails was new but in the space of two weeks I familiarised myself with the basics and could employ it in our group project to build a Rails-based social networking site: **[[Heroku Demo](https://acebook-bcds.herokuapp.com/)]** **[[Acebook (GitHub repo)](https://github.com/dafuloth/acebook-bcds)]**
- **Great collaborator:**
  - In pairing and in group projects, I work well with others and can explain my thought process so that we make progress together
- **Applying industry-standard practices:**
  - <a title = "Programming paradigm">**OOP**</a>, <a title = "Software Development Process">**TDD**</a> and <a title = "Software Development Process">**BDD**</a>, with testing frameworks: **RSpec**, **Jasmine**, **pytest**, **Cypress**
  - <a title = "Design pattern">**MVC**</a>
  - *Linting* and *code quality* with **rubocop**, **eslint**, **pylint**
  - Integrating with services to track test coverage and code quality: e.g. **Coveralls**, **CodeClimate** 
  - Implementing and using a **CI/CD** pipeline with **Travis CI** and **Heroku**
  - Group projects employing **Agile** processes: *listing & prioritising* tasks, making **estimations**, deciding the **MVP**, pairing in 2-day **sprints**, observing agile ceremonies (morning **stand-ups**, end-of-day **retros**) 

### University of Reading

#### DipHE Applied Computer Science (2006 - deferred)

Had my first formal programming courses. Learning **C** & **C++**, and fundamental programming concepts made every other language I would later encounter more accessible, e.g. **Java**, **C#**.

The **algorithms** module introduced me to algorithmic complexity and **Python**.

In **computer architecture**, **operating systems**, and **compilers**, I gained insight into the relationship between hardware and software, and how computers work under the hood.

_Science Foundation Year (2005 - 2006):_ Physics (77%); Mathematics (75.5%); Electrical Science (67%)

_I was active in student media, and in the Microsoft Imagine Cup:_
- Team Leader  
  [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Cup) 2007 Software Design UK Finals - Theme: _Better Education_
- Team Member  
  [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Cup) 2006 Software Design UK Finals - Theme: _Healthier Lives_

## More about me

I am passionate about solving real problems and building useful things, using code. Life, health, and circumstances might have had other ideas but software engineering has been a lifelong ambition that I am now making a reality, thanks to the Makers Fellowship programme.

My journey started in primary school with a little pixellated turtle. Moving it around the screen with commands in Logo might not have looked like much but it was the spark that opened my mind to the possibilities of programming, and I've been hooked ever since. From there: QuickBASIC (from the Windows 95 CD-ROM!), Visual Basic, C/C++, C#, Java and now more recently, Ruby and JavaScript. The language may change but the problem-solving thought process is universal.

In a time when 28.8k dial-up internet was common and 56k was bleeding edge, when the web was rather more read-only (compared to what it is now), my interest was in making desktop applications that ran locally but technology, and my perspective, has evolved a lot since then. My mind is open to the possibilities that now exist: the web is _the_ platform and I want to build web applications!


## Skills

The value of my side-projects and extra-curricular activities is that they have been such a good way to hone my skills:

#### I can justify my position and bring others with me

The website of the student newspaper had gone down a while ago, and had remained so. No one knew what to do about it and they were concerned about the time/money/skills that would be needed to fix it.

I suggested that it was important for a newspaper to have a functioning website and I persuaded the team to support the website project by laying out a plan for going forward: I could start by doing some troubleshooting on my own to diagnose the problem so that we would know if it would actually cost anything at all.

#### I am a _proactive_ problem solver

I determined the problem, and demonstrating *initiative* I took ownership of the issue and got the site back up and running.

#### I write

Whether it was my work on the University of Reading student newspaper, [The Spark](https://issuu.com/sparkweb/docs) or my [blogging](https://blog.makersacademy.com/tagged/makers-survival-guide) while at Makers, I have always been keen on communicating in writing to share knowledge and ideas with others.

## Experience

- **IKEA Wembley** (2014 to 2018)  
*Customer Service Co-worker*  
From the checkouts, to the Returns department, and finally the Customer Care office. I would always listen (or read) carefully in order to clearly understand what the issue is, and then aim to resolve the issue in the most efficient way possible. 

- **Oracle Corporation UK Ltd.** (2008)  
*QA Engineer - Industrial Placement*  
Recognising that software development is more than just coding, I chose this placement in functional QA to gain insight into this important part of the Software Development Life-Cycle. I had to familiarise myself with the specifications and design documents in order to contribute to the test plans. I would carry out manual tests and document the outcomes.
